# Pintos Project 1: Threads - Alarm Clock and Advanced Scheduler

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Project 1** for the **Software Infrastructure (IF677)** course at **CIn-UFPE**. The project focuses on enhancing the Pintos operating system by implementing an **alarm clock** and an **advanced scheduler** for thread management.

## Group Members

- **Alberto Guevara de AraÃºjo Franca**
- **Felipe Mateus FalcÃ£o Barreto**
- **Felipe Torres de Macedo**

## Project Goals

1. **Alarm Clock**:
   - Implement a mechanism to allow threads to wake up at specific times.
   - Ensure that threads are correctly unblocked when their alarm time expires.
   - Handle thread priority adjustments based on alarm time.

2. **Advanced Scheduler**:
   - Enhance the default scheduler (round-robin) to support multiple priority levels.
   - Implement the **Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)** scheduling algorithm.
   - Prioritize threads based on their recent CPU usage and execution history.

## Tools Used

- **Git**: Version control system for collaborative development.
- **Live Share**: Collaborative real-time coding sessions.
- **Bochs(2.6.11) and QEMU**: Simulators for testing and debugging Pintos.
